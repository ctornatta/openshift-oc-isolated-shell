# Overview

My attempt to solve an issue where I want to isolate my "oc" login session to my active shell. When administrating multiple OpenShift environments and your home directory is shared this can help solve the problems of all of your open terminals sharing the same "oc" login/session. This particularly solves the issue when you want to log into the environment as a cluster administrator and you don't want your oc session to be shared.

This script is a first rough stab at the issue.
